# React-Laravel-JWT aut

This is basic example of JWT auth with Laravel on backend and React on Frontend.

## To register user:

Input name, email, password on frontend and send.

If the registration is successful - alert will appear informing the user of successful registration.

## To Log in:

Use bottom form to log in with email and password.

If the login was successful - the alert will appear in the same way as in after registration
and instead of login form the token will be displayed.
